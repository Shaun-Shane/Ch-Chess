# ChineseChess
This repository contains a Chinese Chess agent based on MiniMAX with Alpha-Beta Pruning, and it provides support for the Universal Chinese Chess Protocol (UCCI).

The agent demonstrates a search capability reaching a depth of 11, coupled with a quiescent search that remains within a depth limit of 64, all accomplished within a 60-second time frame.

The agent's skill level is akin to that of a Chess Wizard grandmaster, securing the top rank in a course competition by outperforming agents created by fellow students.
